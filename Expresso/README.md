# Expresso (Main Project)

Self-contained, modularized.

## Road Map

1. V1: Variable, Condition, Reader, Writer, Processor, Workflow
2. V2: Visualization, Algorithms Toolbox (Reader and Processor)
3. V3: Large numerical data optimization

## Technical Note

* Normal (GUI) application evaluates all queries on-demand, while during workflow execution and headless mode, query results are cached.
