# Expresso (Main Project)

Self-contained, modularized.

## Road Map

1. V1: Variable, Condition, Reader, Writer, Processor, Workflow
2. V2: Visualization, Algorithms Toolbox (Reader and Processor)
3. V3: Large numerical data optimization

# Expresso Best Practice

## Namving Conventions

Generally, don''t use space and special symbols in names.

* Variables: Use `lowerCamelCase` for variable names.
* Readers: Use `CamelCase` for reader names.
